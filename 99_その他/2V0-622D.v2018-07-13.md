A. It balances resource utilization for virtual machines with unpredictable utilization patterns. B. It integrates DRS with vRealize Operations Manager to balance workloads for virtual machines before resource utilization spikes occur. C. It balances resource utilization based on a threshold’s algorithm that runs each night. D. It determines the best placement and balance of virtual machines based on a threshold’s algorithm that runs each night in vCenter Server 6.5 Database.
Correct Answer: BC Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference: Explanation: Predictive DRS Predictive DRS is a new feature that leverages the predictive analytics of vRealize Operations Manager with the powerful resource scheduler algorithm of vSphere DRS. Together, these two products enable workload balancing for certain VMs before resource utilization spikes occur, potentially eliminating a great amount of resource contention that might have occurred in the past. vRealize Operations Manager runs its dynamic thresholds algorithm nightly against the VMs on which it collects data. These dynamic thresholds create forecasted metrics for the future utilization of the VMs. The metrics are then passed to vSphere DRS to determine the best placement and balance of VMs before resource utilization spikes occur. Predictive DRS helps prevent resource contention on hosts that run VMs with predictable utilization patterns.

Explanation/Reference: Explanation: The default gateway is an entry point and an exit point in a virtual machine sub-net, VLAN, or network.
In general, a gateway is a routing device that knows how to pass traffic between different subnets and networks.
Layer 2 and layer 3 switches with VLAN configuration allow IP assignment to each VLAN that will be used as default gateway as for that particular VLAN. A router contains routes for other subnets. Therefore, the problem occurs when wrong VLAN ID is added to the portgroup.

QUESTION 45 Which is true when assigning global permissions in a single vSphere Single Sign-On domain in a multi-site configuration?
A. Users assigned global permissions will be able to access objects and solutions across all Single SignOn domains in an organization. B. Users assigned global permissions will be able to access objects and solutions only in the same Single Sign-On site. C. Users assigned global permissions will have administrator access across all objects and solutions in a Single Sign-On domain. D. Users assigned global permissions will be able to access objects and solutions within that Single SignOn domain.
Correct Answer: D Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference: Explanation Global permissions are applied to a global root object that spans solutions, for example, both vCenter Server and vCenter Orchestrator. Use global permissions to give a user or group privileges for all objects in all object hierarchies. Each solution has a root object in its own object hierarchy. The global root object acts as a parent object to each solution object. You can assign global permissions to users or groups, and decide on the role for each user or group. The role determines the set of privileges. You can assign a predefined role or create custom roles.

QUESTION 50 When using DPM in a vSphere HA cluster with Admission Control enabled, which two statements are true? (Choose two.)
A. DPM can not be enabled on a cluster with HA Admission control enabled. B. If necessary, DPM powers on hosts from standby mode to maintain failover needs. C. EVC must be enabled on the cluster before DPM can be enabled. D. DPM and HA do not interact with each other. There will be no change in behavior when DPM is enabled on a cluster using HA. E. DPM does not place hosts in standby mode if doing so would violate failover requirements.
Correct Answer: BE Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference: Explanation DRS does not evacuate virtual machines from a host for the purpose of placing it in maintenance mode or standby mode if placing the host in this state would violate failover requirements. You can still manually evacuate virtual machines in order to place hosts in maintenance mode or standby mode. If you violate failover requirements by doing this, however, the cluster turns red. VMware DPM does not place hosts in standby mode if doing so would violate failover requirements If necessary, VMware DPM powers on hosts (brings them out of standby mode) to maintain failover needs. A minimum of two hosts must be powered on in any HA-enabled cluster.

QUESTION 54 A vSphere administrator upgraded vCenter Server (VC) from version 5.5 to 6.5. Existing VMFS5 datastores consumption is 75% full. All of the ESXi hosts have been upgraded to version 6.5. Existing datastores have not yet been upgraded.
Which is VMware’s recommended approach to upgrading each VMFS5 datastore to VMFS6?
A. The option to upgrade datastores to VMFS6 is only available during the ESXi host upgrade process. B. Log on one ESXi host at a time using vSphere 6.5 Windows Client. Navigate to the datastores view. Right-click on the VMFS5 datastore, and then select upgrade to VMFS6. C. Log on to VC using vSphere 6.5 Web Client. Navigate to the datastores view. Right-click on the VMFS5 datastore, and then select upgrade to VMFS6. D. Log on to VC using vSphere 6.5 Web Client. Create a VMFS6 datastore on a new LUN. Use storage vMotion to migrate the data to the new datastore.
Correct Answer: D Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference: Explanation: Perform version check for the vCenter Server and all ESX hosts. Note: All ESXi hosts and vCenter Server must be of vSphere 6.5. Do not proceed if any one of ESXi hosts is not vSphere 6.5. Proceeding further means business continuity loss and the new datastore is not visible in old ESX hosts. Perform all pre checks for free space availability on datastore DS-2. Available space on DS-2 must be equal or more than the datastore DS-1 space. Ensure that the datastore DS-2 is VMFS 6 type. Prepare list of all virtual machines in the vCenter Server’s inventory that are hosted on datastore DS-1. Evacuate the datastore DS-1. For this, migrate all the virtual machines running from datastore DS-1 to datastore DS-2. Storage vMotion operations are performed on these virtual machines. Perform one migration at a time to avoid disrupting the performance of remaining datacenter entities. Keep track of any migration failures, if any, re-trigger the migration for those virtual machines. Ensure that datastore DS-1 is empty by listing files on this datastore. Note: Proceed further only if datastore DS-1 is empty. Unmount datastore DS-1 from all ESX hosts.
Delete datastore DS-1. Create a new datastore with the VMFS 6 filesystem using the same lun. For example, DS-1. Trigger a storage rescan operation on all hosts and wait for few minutes for this operation to complete. Move all virtual machines back to datastore DS-1 from datastore DS-2 by performing storage vMotion operation. It is suggested to migrate one virtual machine at a time. Keep track of any migration failures, if any, re-trigger migration for those virtual machines.
