QUESTION 1 What are two reasons why a datastore in a Storage DRS cluster cannot enter maintenance mode? (Choose two.)
A. Storage latency is too high to allow Storage DRS initiate Storage vMotion. B. Storage DRS is configured for a VMFS3 datastore. C. Storage DRS is disabled on the virtual disk. D. Rules prevent Storage DRS from making migration recommendations.
Correct Answer: CD Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Datastore Cannot Enter Maintenance Mode You place a datastore in maintenance mode when you must take it out of usage to service it. A datastore enters or leaves maintenance mode only as a result of a user request. Problem A datastore in a datastore cluster cannot enter maintenance mode. The Entering Maintenance Mode status remains at 1%. Cause One or more disks on the datastore cannot be migrated with Storage vMotion. This condition can occur in the following instances. ■ Storage DRS is disabled on the disk. ■ Storage DRS rules prevent Storage DRS from making migration recommendations for the disk.

QUESTION 27 Which two components are part of storage I/O multipathing on ESXi? (Choose two.)
A. SATP B. VASA C. PSP D. VAAI
Correct Answer: AC Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference: VMware Multipathing Module
By default, ESXi provides an extensible multipathing module called the Native Multipathing Plug-In (NMP). Generally, the VMware NMP supports all storage arrays listed on the VMware storage HCL and provides a default path selection algorithm based on the array type. The NMP associates a set of physical paths with a specific storage device, or LUN. The specific details of handling path failover for a given storage array are delegated to a Storage Array Type Plug-In (SATP). The specific details for determining which physical path is used to issue an I/O request to a storage device are handled by a Path Selection Plug-In (PSP). SATPs and PSPs are sub plug-ins within the NMP module.

QUESTION 44 Which two statements are true for NFS v4.1 firewall behavior? (Choose two.)
A. It closes port 2049. B. It sets allowedAll flag to TRUE. C. It sets allowedAll flag to FALSE. D. It opens port 2049.
Correct Answer: BD Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference: NFS v4.1 Firewall Behavior When you mount the first NFS v4.1 datastore, ESXi enables the nfs41client rule set and sets its allowedAll flag to TRUE. This action opens port 2049 for all IP addresses. Unmounting an NFS v4.1 datastore does not affect the firewall state. That is, the first NFS v4.1 mount opens port 2049 and that port remains enabled unless you close it explicitly.

QUESTION 62 When using "Cluster resource percentage" for host failover capacity in vSphere HA Admission Control, the total resource requirements are calculated from which two values? (Choose two.)
A. Total vCPUs assigned to each VM. B. Average CPU usage on each VM over time. C. Memory reservations on each VM. D. Total memory assigned to each VM. E. Average active memory on each VM over time. F. CPU reservations on each VM.
Correct Answer: CF Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
vSphere HA uses the actual reservations of the virtual machines. If a virtual machine does not have reservations, meaning that the reservation is 0, a default of 0MB memory and 32MHz CPU is applied.
Computing the Current Failover Capacity The total resource requirements for the powered-on virtual machines is comprised of two components, CPU
and memory. vSphere HA calculates these values. The CPU component by summing the CPU reservations of the powered-on virtual machines. If you have not specified a CPU reservation for a virtual machine, it is assigned a default value of 32MHz (this value can be changed using the das.vmcpuminmhz advanced option.) The memory component by summing the memory reservation (plus memory overhead) of each powered-on virtual machine.

QUESTION 64 Which are two vCenter Server two-factor authentication methods? (Choose two.)
A. RSA SecurID B. Smart Card C. SAML D. Symantec VIP
Correct Answer: AB
Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.psc.doc/GUID-ACFFCBEC-6C1C-4BF99971-04AEE9362AFE.html
Two-Factor Authentication Methods The two-factor authentication methods are often required by government agencies or large enterprises.
Smart card authentication
Smart card authentication allows access only to users who attach a physical card to the USB drive of the computer that they log in to. An example is Common Access Card (CAC) authentication.
The administrator can deploy the PKI so that the smart card certificates are the only client certificates that the CA issues. For such deployments, only smart card certificates are presented to the user. The user selects a certificate, and is prompted for a PIN. Only users who have both the physical card and the PIN that matches the certificate can log in.
RSA SecurID Authentication
For RSA SecurID authentication, your environment must include a correctly configured RSA Authentication Manager. If the Platform Services Controller is configured to point to the RSA server, and if RSA SecurID Authentication is enabled, users can log in with their user name and token.
See the two vSphere Blog posts about RSA SecurID setup for details.

QUESTION 99 Which two encryption keys does the host use when encrypting virtual machine files? (Choose two.)
A. Public Key Infrastructure Encryption Key (PKI) B. Master Encryption Key (MEK) C. Data Encryption Key (DEK) D. Key Encryption Key (KEK)
Correct Answer: CD Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The ESXi host generates and uses internal keys to encrypt virtual machines and disks. These keys are used as the disk encryption key (DEK) and are XTS-AES-256 keys. ■ The key management server (KMS) sends keys to the vCenter Server upon request. These keys are used as the key encryption key (KEK) and are AES-256 keys. vCenter Server stores only the ID of each KEK, but not the key itself. ■ ESXi hosts use the KEK to encrypt their internal keys, and store only the encrypted internal keys on disk, but not the KEK itself. When an ESXi host reboots, vCenter Server requests the necessary KEKs by sending the corresponding IDs to the KMS, and upon receipt, make the KEKs available to the ESXi host, which can then decrypt its internal keys as needed.
QUESTION 100 An administrator wants to upgrade ESXi 5.5 hosts to ESXi 6.5 using Update Manager. When performing a scan for baseline compliance, the host's status is marked Compliant. Which has happened?

QUESTION 101 A VM-Host affinity rule states that VM group "X" must run on hosts in group "Y". If all ESXi hosts in group "Y" fail, which is the resulting behavior with vSphere HA enabled?
A. The virtual machines in group "X" will failover to hosts that do not belong to group "Y", but will vMotion back to hosts in group "Y" when they become available. B. The virtual machines in group "X" will not failover to hosts that do not belong to group "Y". C. This scenario is not possible because vSphere HA and DRS cannot work together. D. The virtual machines in group "X" will only fail over to hosts that do not belong to group "Y" if they are marked as "High" VM Restart Priority within vSphere HA.
Correct Answer: B Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.avail.doc/GUID-1D8B1384-59A441E2-AF05-697FC06D9EF9.html

C. Create a Network Resource Pool on the Distributed Switch and set a reservation quota. D. Reserve bandwidth for virtual machine system traffic on the Distributed Switch. E. Add the Network Resource Pool on the Distributed Switch Port Group.
Correct Answer: CDE Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc/GUID-E333032FC292-4351-8318-C201F0579846.html#GUID-E333032F-C292-4351-8318-C201F0579846
To limit via port group you must create a network resource pool and add the VDS port group to it. To create a quota in the network resource pool you need a reservation at the VDS level first.
QUESTION 103 An administrator would like to configure vSphere HA to use two isolation addresses.
How would this affect the behavior of HA?
A. If both isolation addresses are not reachable, the host will be restarted by the HA agent. B. If both isolation addresses are not reachable, the host will use the vCenter Server IP address as a final isolation address before being marked isolated. C. If only one of the isolation addresses is reachable, the host will not be marked isolated by HA. D. If only one of the isolation addresses is reachable, the host will be considered in an isolated by HA.
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none) Explanation
Explanation/Reference: Isolation addresses are checked to test if the host’s networking is working when the slave host doesn’t hear heartbeats from a Master host. Only one needs to work for it to know that it’s network is working. The point in multiple isolation addresses is to provide redundancy in case one fails.
QUESTION 104 ESXi hosts with 10Gbps network cards are attached to a distributed switch.
